# Changelog / Release Notes

### New features

**Availability & Blockout Date Management**
- Admins can now block date ranges per vehicle or fleet-wide from Admin → Blockouts

- Per-vehicle blockouts also manageable directly on each vehicle's edit page
- Blocked dates appear as grey bars on the admin calendar
- Public booking app and per-vehicle booking pages both respect blockouts
- Blockout reason is internal-only — not visible to customers

**Automated Email Sequences**
- Customers now receive an automatic confirmation email when a booking is submitted (Booking Received)
- Customers + admin notification email receive a confirmation when booking is set to Confirmed
- Daily cron sends 24hr reminders to customer + admin the day before a confirmed booking starts
- Daily cron sends a post-trip follow-up to customer + admin the day after a booking ends

**Customer Profiles & Booking History**
- New Admin → Customers section lists all customers grouped by email with booking count, total spend, and last booking date
- Per-customer page shows full booking history with booking refs, vehicle, dates, cost, and status

**Enquiry Pipeline**
- New Admin → Enquiries section lists all waitlist enquiries with filter tabs: New, Contacted, Converted, Lost

- "Convert to Booking" promotes the enquiry to a pending booking seamlessly
- New "Enquiry — Dates Now Available" email template editable via Admin → Settings → Email Templates

**Customer Enhancements**
- Vendor customer bookings now visible in Admin → Customers (already stored in Booking table)
- Archive/hide a customer from the customer list (booking records are preserved)
